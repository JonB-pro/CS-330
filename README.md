## How I approach designing software:
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new skills I have now include being able to render primitives in a window, and change their color, texture, size and positioning. I also know how to integrate mouse and keyboard input with OpenGL and have the appropriate responses occur.
### What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process used was to work on the overall project in small batches while applying the new skills I had learned that week to anything I had developed already.
### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Working in small quantities while applying new concepts every time can be applied in the future to any project as it is a good process to follow while working on a large commitment.

## How I approach developing programs:
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Development strategies that I implemented included focusing on specific areas while working, and then once an initial run succeeded, adding new facets to the whole.
### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration is what allowed me to add on after testing an initial run. I developed an initial shape first by working on each function seperately, and once it was working properly I added more shapes, focusing on each one as a whole instead of by function. This was possible because of the iteration testing done.
### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
As previously stated, it started small scope, function to function, and moved to a larger scope of shape by shape.

## How computer science can help me in reaching my goals:
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
These fields give me new knowlwedge that I can apply to future software development by giving me a basis to understand rendering programs other than OpenGL, and also dive deeper into OpenGL itself.
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
These fields will help me professionally as well, since I now have a base knowledge of graphics rendering and setup. I can apply this knowledge to any projects that may require me to develop visual aspects of software for a company.
